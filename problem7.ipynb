    "If a number $n$ is non-prime, having a factor $r$, then $n = rs$, where $s$ is also a factor. If $r \\geq \\sqrt{n}$ then $n = rs \\geq \\sqrt{n} s$, which implies that $s \\leq \\sqrt{n}$. In other words, any non-prime must have factors, and hence also prime factors, less than or equal to $\\sqrt{n}$. Thus to determine if a number is prime we have to check its prime factors only up to and including $\\sqrt{n}$ — if there are none then the number is prime.\n",

    "If we find even a single prime factor less than $\\sqrt{n}$ then we know that the number is non-prime, and hence there is no need to check any further — we can abandon this number and move on to something else."
